# ðŸ§  AI Resumeâ€“Job Description Analyzer

This project is a **Resume Screening System** that takes a **Job Description (JD)** and a **Resume** as input, analyzes them using AI, and gives a detailed match report including skills matched, missing skills, and overall match score.

---

## Features

- Upload **Resume** (PDF/DOCX) and **Job Description** (PDF/DOCX)
- **AI-powered analysis** for matching resumes with JDs
- Provides:
  - **Match Score** (0-100%)
  - **Matched Skills**
  - **Missing/Weak Skills**
  - **Summary/Explanation**
- Highlights resumes with **strong matches** (â‰¥ 80%)

---

## How It Works

1. **FastAPI Backend** (`read_doc.py`):
   - Extracts text from uploaded PDF or DOCX files
   - Sends text to **Groq AI** for analysis
   - Returns structured JSON with match score, skills, and summary

2. **Streamlit Frontend** (`web_app.py`):
   - Simple web interface for users to upload files
   - Calls FastAPI backend and displays results in a user-friendly format

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - API keys are stored in a `.env` file for security:
     ```text
     GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
     ```

python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in project root with your API key:

text
Copy code
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
Run FastAPI backend:

bash

Notes
Only Resume (PDF/DOCX) and JD (PDF/DOCX) are supported.

API keys must never be pushed to GitHub. Always use .env for security.

Match score â‰¥ 80% is considered a strong match.

If you want, I can also make a **more visually appealing README** with **badges, GIF preview, and headings** so it looks very professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
